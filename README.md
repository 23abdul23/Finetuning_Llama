# Finetuning_Llama
Fine-tuning large language models like LLaMA has transformed the way we adapt pre-trained models for specialized tasks. This repository focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA and QLoRA to adapt the LLaMA2-7B model to Indian legal text datasets.<br>

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with fine-tuning the LLaMA2-7B model on a dataset related to Indian laws to make it capable of generating context-aware legal insights. The challenge is to leverage advanced fine-tuning techniques like LoRA/QLoRA to optimize the training process while keeping computational requirements minimal. Demonstrate your skills in model tuning and deployment! <br>

## Instructions

- Refer to articles, research papers, and official documentation for guidance on techniques and best practices.

- Do not alter any pre-written code or comments.

- Write code only in the provided space and document your steps with comments for better understanding.

- Use Google Colab or similar GPU-enabled environments for training and testing the model. <br>
